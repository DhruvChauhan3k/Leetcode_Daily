# Purpose and Features
The primary purpose of this repository is to document my progress and growth as a programmer by showcasing the problems I solve on a regular basis. By maintaining a daily problem-solving routine, I aim to enhance my algorithmic thinking skills, improve problem-solving strategies, and deepen my understanding of various data structures and algorithms.

Key features of this repository include:

Problem Organization: The repository is structured to provide easy navigation and access to the daily solved problems. Each problem is contained within its own dedicated folder, labeled with the corresponding problem's unique identifier.

Solution Implementation: For each problem, you will find a well-documented solution implemented in a programming language of choice, typically focusing on readability, efficiency, and best coding practices. The code includes comments to explain the thought process, algorithmic approach, and any important considerations.

Test Cases: Whenever possible, test cases are provided to validate the correctness of the solution. These test cases cover a range of input scenarios, edge cases, and constraints defined by the problem statement.

Problem Descriptions: Alongside each solution, you will find a clear and concise description of the problem statement, including any constraints, requirements, and expected outcomes. This helps provide context and aids in understanding the problem at hand.

Daily Progress: The commit history showcases a daily log of problems solved, demonstrating a consistent commitment to daily coding practice. This not only serves as a personal reference but also allows others to track the progress made over time.
